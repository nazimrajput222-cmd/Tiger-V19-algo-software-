TIGER BRAIN — ONE MAN ARMY (Unified Engine)
============================================
Super Powerful Race Car + Sniper + Research Tool. One engine, everything in.

ARCHITECTURE: SCORING, NOT GATING
==================================
Pehle 10+ hard gates stack karne se 99.85% entries reject ho rahe the.
Ab sirf 2 HARD requirements hain, baaki sab SCORE bonus hai:

HARD REQUIREMENTS (must pass — ~50% pass rate):
  1. Zone touch on 1m bar (real S/D zone, not random level)
  2. Volume delta in correct direction (1.3x surge — institutional participation)

SCORE BOOSTERS (add to score, don't reject — rank & take top entries):
  +10  Explosive zone quality (big momentum — zone_explosive_quality)
  +8   Liquidity sweep (smart money stop-hunt — liquidity_sweep)
  +5   Delta spike 1.8x (strong institutional volume — delta_spike_confirms)
  +5   Trend alignment (15m HH+HL for Call, LH+LL for Put)
  +5   PDH/PDL confluence (zone near Previous Day High/Low — institutional memory)
  +5   VWAP confluence (zone near intraday VWAP — consensus level)
  +3   Golden window morning (09:15-11:30 — best institutional flow)
  +2   Golden window afternoon (13:00-15:15 — closing momentum)
  +3   PCR sentiment alignment (PCR confirms direction)
  +2   India VIX low (<15 = trending day, good for momentum)
  +3   Opening range alignment (breakout direction matches trade direction)

ALL 5 BRAINS AWAKE (as scorers, not gates):
  Brain 1: brain1_intraday_pass (gate — entry window)
  Brain 2: detect_zones + zone_touched_on_1m + volume_delta (gate)
          + zone_explosive_quality + liquidity_sweep + delta_spike_confirms (scorers)
          + find_opposing_zone (exit target)
  Brain 3: find_sniper_entry internal logic (adapted as scoring pipeline)
  Brain 4: TradeCounterGuard (daily quota)
  Brain 5: check_intraday_exit (full exit engine)

PRICING: Black-Scholes + Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega)
RISK: Structural stop (zone-based) + Dynamic sizing (1% risk, ₹2K cap)

Catches BOTH big AND small momentum — explosive zones get +10 score,
but non-explosive zones with good confluence still enter.
