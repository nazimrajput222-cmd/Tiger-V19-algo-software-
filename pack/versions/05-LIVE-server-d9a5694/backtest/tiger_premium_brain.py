Tiger Brain V18 — PREMIUM DISCOUNT SNIPER (Brain 6)
====================================================
Yeh Tiger ki sabse important brain hai — PREMIUM ko discount pe
kharidti hai aur expensive pe bechti hai. 3x-5x returns ka secret
yahi hai.

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
  - Options premium = Intrinsic + Time Value (IV dependent)
  - Jab IV LOW hota hai → premium SASTA (discount) → BUY
  - Jab IV HIGH hota hai → premium MEHENGA (expensive) → SELL
  - Discount buy + IV expansion sell = 3x-5x returns

HOW IT WORKS:
  1. Track IV (realized vol) per symbol over lookback window
  2. Compute IV Percentile — where does current IV sit vs history?
     - 0-30%   = DEEP DISCOUNT (premium cheapest) → best entry
     - 30-50%  = DISCOUNT (good entry)
     - 50-65%  = FAIR (only if rocket score 90+)
     - 65-100% = EXPENSIVE (block entry, exit if holding)

  3. Strike Selection Matrix:
     - IV <25% → OTM (cheapest, max gamma, IV expand pe sabse zyada % move)
     - IV 25-50% → ATM (balanced)
     - IV >50% → ITM (delta protection, but block if >65%)

  4. IV Expansion Exit:
     - Exit when IV percentile > 70% (premium became expensive = SELL!)
     - This captures the full IV expansion cycle: buy cheap → sell expensive

This brain works WITH Brain 7 (Session Commander) — lunch lull
(1:00-2:30 PM) is the best discount window.
